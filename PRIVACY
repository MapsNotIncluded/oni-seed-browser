Privacy Policy

ONI Seed Browser is a free and open-source app.
We do not collect, store, or share any personal data by default.

We do not serve ads or use any form of user tracking.

Users can optionally log in with their Steam account to:
- Mark maps as favorites
- Set a name on the leaderboard
- Request seeds to be added to the database

When logging in, we only receive the Steam ID. We do not request or access additional profile information.
Your Steam ID is never shown to other users and we take reasonable measures to keep it secure.

We use Sentry.io as a third-party service to collect crash reports.
These reports may include the Steam ID if it was part of the session when the crash occurred.
