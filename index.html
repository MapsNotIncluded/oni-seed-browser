    <p>The ONI Seed Browser aimed to serve as an open-source alternative to ToolsNotIncluded.net,
        which had been speculated to cease operations by the end of 2023.</p>

    <p>However, Cairath, the developer of ToolsNotIncluded.net, revealed at the beginning of 2024
        that the service would be restored, rendering the need for a replacement obsolete at the time of writing.</p>
